First wave
1) Make Mario able to jump on the pipe, instead of walking through it  - Tarun @Tarun
2) Make Mario walk and jump - Raja @Raja 
3) Make the background screen move whenever Mario is moving in the middle of the screen - Nazrin @naz 
4) Make goomba walks, and die when Mario jumps on him; but Mario dies when Mario touches it on horizontally - Ben @Ben 
5) Make start screen and end screen - Yun Sion @Yun Sion 
6) Display the texts on the top (score, coin, world, time, live) and let the time countdown  - Luke @luke 
7) Add all the bricks and question-marked blocks, when Mario hits the question mark the coin and mushroom should come out  - Eejoy @eejoy 

Second Wave
1) Eejoy: Make the bricks destroyable when mario jumps on them (don't care small or big mario first), also makes the star bounce around 
2) Naz: Make the end game pole scene, the higher Mario goes the higher the scores, after that, do the poll animation and play the poll music
3) Ben: Spawn enemy and make them only start walking when they are inside the screen (within Mario's "vision"), tips: make them only move when their coordinates are <= 1000
4) Yun Sion: When Mario touches the enemy (not just goomba but also koopa) Mario changes to dead animation, jumps up in the sky and then falls down out of the screen, then game over
